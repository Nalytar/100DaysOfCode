# You might ask for another card

# dealer = 20, and we = 20, its draw
# if dealers hand < 17 they must take another card
# if we hit 21 with 2 cards we win

# Everyone gets another face-up card, besides the dealer his card is face-down
# You may ask for another card of the deck ("hit"), there is no limit to how many cards you can ask for
# if your score is over 21 you lose ("bust")
